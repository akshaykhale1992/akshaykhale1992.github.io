<h1>Podcasts for Everyone</h1>

<p>
    Hello world, I am a fan of Ted Talks, I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ted.android&hl=en" target="_blank">Ted APP</a>
    The app is not the greatest app in the world but it works and that was enough for me. The app provides offline save option and has thousands of Ted Talks, which are updated almost once a day.
    No complains at all. But the app didn't have an option where it can just play those talks when the phone is in my pocket or Backpack.
</p>
<p>
    But then google came to rescue, I came across <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Podcasts</a>. A wonderful app with almost all the Podcasts, I would want listen.
</p>
<p>In this articls I am going to share the list of podcasts which I listen and would like to recommend to everyone.</p>
