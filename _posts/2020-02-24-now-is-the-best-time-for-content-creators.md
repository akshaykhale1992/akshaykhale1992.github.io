It’s been more than 7 years since I published my first Blog Post on my first simple [WordPress Blog](https://4androidfans.wordpress.com/). I like to write, I like to talk, I like to share my knowledge. I simply love creating content.

Today, I was going through my old blog, reading comments which gave me goosebumps. This blog taught me a lot. I got to tinker with WordPress, I learned about Webmaster Tools, and Analytics tool. I learned about Search Engine Optimization and every single positive comment was a boost for me to write my next piece of work. I was thrilled by looking at the traffic on my Blog. I agree, it’s not the world’s top tech blog and even my writing was not so compelling but I was happy. While scrolling through those old blog posts, I realized that,

> Now is the best time for content creators.

We are living in the world of the Internet, people are online almost always. There is an arsenal of various free (and premium) tools that will help you distribute your content any kind of content which can help you earn.

You like traveling, You can start a travel blog or a YouTube channel.

You like writing, You can write an E-book and self-publish it or write a personal blog or write and share your thoughts here on Medium.

You like to talk, you can host a podcast.

You have a unique product, You can start an E-commerce website.

Confused!!!

Don’t know where to start, not very tech-savvy.

It’s perfectly alright, you don’t have to be a computer genius to do any of the things listed above. You can start with basic computer knowledge. The internet has an answer for everything. In this article, I am going to share a few options which you can try.

# Video Content

YouTube is one most the easiest way to get started with Video Content distribution. You do not need any special equipment, you can get started with your smartphone.

What Can you do?  
Anything, literally anything which follows [YouTube’s guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/). You can do simple tutorials, educational videos, singing or dance videos, funny videos, Travel videos or anything you like.

YouTube does not charge any fees for publishing and distributing your videos and if your content is great then you will get paid by YouTube for running Ads on your YouTube channel.

There are many YouTube celebrities who do Paid promotions for various products.

# Audio Content

> When it comes to audio content, it’s not just music.

If you are great at conversations or you simply like to talk about any given subject and don’t want to create a YouTube channel then you can consider hosting a Podcast. It could be a conversation with a guest or it could be a talk on some subject, that’s just how most of the people do it but you have complete freedom to start with anything that you may like.

People are swamped with work these days, they do not have time to read huge books hence they prefer Audio-books during their commute, they do not have time for watching TV shows hence they listen to audio shows.

# Written Content

If you are a writer and love to share your thoughts with the world then you can start writing here on Medium, you can start [here](https://medium.com/new-story). Medium has a very simple interface and a large community of readers who will be interested in reading your articles. There are various [topics](https://medium.com/topics) you can start wiring.

Apart from [Medium](https://medium.com/), you can start a simple blog on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). There is a little learning curve there but anyone who has been using the internet and apps on their phone should be able to manage it.

Amazon Kindle provides a [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/) option which allows you to publish your book on Kindle platform which will get distributed to millions of readers on Amazon Kindle. You can read more about it here: [https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200635650](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200635650 "https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200635650")

# Product

You got a great product but do not know how to sell it, then you can either start your own website on [Shopify](https://www.shopify.in/) or you can [register as an Amazon Seller](https://services.amazon.in/) and start selling your products on Amazon.

You don’t need to be a web developer to build an E-commerce store. Webstore management applications like Shopify make it very easy and fast to build your E-commerce store and start selling. It’s just a few clicks to set up the store and after setting up, you can simply add photos of your products and start selling. The basic [Shopify website plan](https://www.shopify.in/pricing) starts with as low as $29 per month (with additional Transaction fees).

**Conclusion**: Various free and paid content distribution platforms are available for content creators which helps them to distribute their content to the right audience.
