<h1>Hello World Jekyll</h1>

<p>This is my first Jekyll post on <a href="https://akshaykhale1992.github.io">My Github page</a>, and I must tell you, it's super simple to publish posts and start a blog without writing a single line of code and I just fell in love with it.</p>

<p>I am using <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/" target="_blank">Clean Blog</a> theme by <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">Start Bootstrap</a>, there are plenty of other themes to choose from...</p>

<h1>Advantages of using Jekyll</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Simple and Easy to setup</li>
	<li>No programming experience required</li>
	<li>Fast</li>
	<li>No Database setup or any other CMS setup required.</li>
</ul>

<p>soon I will be posting a blog post with the instructions to setup and get started with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p><i>Live long and prosper!!!</i></p>
