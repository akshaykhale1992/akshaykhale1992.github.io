I came across this Ted Talk(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) a few days back which was Published on 23 May 2007 and I realized that we are claiming that we are creating Smart AI system which will replicate human brain. An AI which will work like the human brain, think like humans. The AI which will be creative like the human brain. But my personal opinion is Nope. We are not building a genius AI. Instead, we are building a stupid AI systems. I can understand if you are outraged by my comment, but please bear with me I will try to justify comment, after all, I am also a pro-AI Person, living with the dream is to unlock mysteries of the human brain.
Right now we are building AI which will learn from data without understanding whether data is correct or invalid whereas the human brain is magical, it understands the invalid data but treats invalid data properly.
